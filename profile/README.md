Our "FamilySleeps" project will be the first study to investigate circadian rhythms in families. We will do this in the context of genetic, environmental, and social synchrony in families with neurodevelopmental conditions. This project has received funding from a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Investigator Grant awarded to Dr Lorna Lopez, under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 950010).

​

We are building a team of scientific and clinical researchers, with public patient involvement experts, to work on the underlying biological basis of disrupted circadian rhythms in families. This understanding will help address sleep disruption and other poor outcomes in families with autism, as well as increasing our understanding of the role of circadian rhythms in neurodevelopment in a family context.
